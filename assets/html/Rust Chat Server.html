            During my Erasmus in Hochschule Darmstadt, I chose to do a module called Advanced System Programming, which was taught using Rust. The final project was a team project where we had to showcase what we have learned throughout the semester. My teammate and myself chose to do a chat server, with them working on the client side, and me working on the server side.
