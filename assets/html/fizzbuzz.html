            And finally I want to present something that probably isn't the best code quality example, but I felt highlighted that I always love a challenge, this is FizzBuzz without using a single if or ternary operator.
            By using an array to manipulate where a text is written we can change how it is written and what exactly is written.
            <br>
            <br>
            This solution also only uses 7 lines of code and thats including the "include", and void main.
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded"><code class="text-monospace">#include <stdio.h>
void main(){

    char Out[9] = {'\0'}; // zero'd out array of characters

    for(int i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
        //Out[0] = '\0';
        //Out[4] = '\0';

        //converts the word "fizz" into an integer and then multiplies it by 1 if i is a modulo of 1 otherwises sets it to 0
        *(int *)&Out[0] = !(i%3) * *(int *)"fizz",

        //converts the word "buzz" into an integer and then multiplies it by 1 if i is a modulo of 5 otherwises sets it to 0
        //if i is also a modulo of 3 it offsets the writing index of Out by 4 so buzz is written to the end of the line
        *(int *)&Out[!(i%3)*4] = !(i%5) * *(int *)"buzz",

        //prints it out but only prints out the number if the FizzBuzz isnt printed, otherwise it prints a 0 and deletes it
        printf("%3d : %s%d%c \n", i, Out, !!(i%3) * !!(i%5) * i,(!(i%3) || !(i%5)) * '\b');
    }
}
