            During my Erasmus I also did a module called "Construction of Multi-Touch and Multi-User Interfaces" while at Hochschule Darmstadt. This module helped develop my understanding on how multi-touch devices, that can also handle multiple users at once, can be created.

            This module also thaught me about simple Gesture recognition using the 1$ algorithim, and how it can be used to recognise different gestures no matter the oriention of the user.

            This project unfortunately doesn't have a git-repo as you either require a multi-touch table, or a specific app for it work, and the app is unfortunately and only works on older versions of android, and until I either make my own app, or find an alternative, I do not feel it is good practice to upload this project
