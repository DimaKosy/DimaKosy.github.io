        <p>
            This was my final year project for my Computer Science degree. I chose to create world
            generation system using tectonic plates as I felt that Perlin noise dominated everything and
            I wanted to try something different.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project took the entirety of my final year to complete as I had chosen to do everything
            from scratch including collision detection.
            This was written entirely in C++ and the only non standard library that was used was the
            RayLib Graphics library as I felt that if I also chose to try and create my own graphics
            framework on top of everything I'd lose all hope of being able to complete the project in
            the timeframe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even without having to write my own graphics library, I still had a lot I needed to do,
            including initial plate generation, collision detection, and deformation. With this project
            I originally aimed for trying to create an infinitely generated procedural system for
            continous tectonic simulation but due to time limitations it had to be limited to a fixed
            size world that wrapped around on itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite all the challenges and obstacles I had to overcome I managed to make a fast and
            efficient system that could generate terrain, albeit it had a lot of room to grow and
            improve.
