                <p>
                    My name is Dmytro Kosynskyy, I'm a recent Computer Science graduate, from the Technological
                    University of Dublin (TUD), with hands-on experience in backend development, distributed systems,
                    game programming, and database engineering. I enjoy building efficient, scalable software using
                    tools like C++, Python, and Java. Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities to work as a Software
                    Engineer with a focus on system design, backend infrastructure, or database technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my time in both secondary school and college I have made various achievements, and have joined many clubs and activities. During college I was both the treasurer and vice-captain of the archery teaming, and went to various competions to other colleges.
                    I have also been apart of my debating team in secondary school and took part in the Concern debates. I enjoy going on hikes through various and forests, as well as riding my motorbike through scenic routes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I still may be early in my career I hope you keep both me and my page in mind as I continue to develop my skills and abilities. Please don't hesitate to contact me through LinkedIn.
