                    <p>
                        My name is Dmytro Kosynskyy, I'm a recent Computer Science graduate, from the Technological University of Dublin (TUD), with hands-on experience in backend development, distributed systems, game programming, and database engineering. I enjoy building efficient, scalable software using tools like C++, Python, and Java. Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities to work as a Software Engineer with a focus on system design, backend infrastructure, or database technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having studied in TUD, I have achieved a Honours Bachelor Degree for Computer Science International. Having done an International course this meant I had the opportunity to travel abroad for Erasmus, during which I studied in Hochschule Darmstadt which helped me further develop my skills.

                                    This was my final year project for my Computer Science degree. I chose to create world generation system using tectonic plates as I felt that Perlin noise dominated everything and I wanted to try something different.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This project took the entirety of my final year to complete as I had chosen to do everything from scratch including collision detection.
                                    This was written entirely in C++ and the only non standard library that was used was the RayLib Graphics library as I felt that if I also chose to try and create my own graphics framework on top of everything I'd lose all hope of being able to complete the project in the timeframe.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Even without having to write my own graphics library, I still had a lot I needed to do, including initial plate generation, collision detection, and deformation. With this project I originally aimed for trying to create an infinitely generated procedural system for continous tectonic simulation but due to time limitations it had to be limited to a fixed size world that wrapped around on itself.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Despite all the challenges and obstacles I had to overcome I managed to make a fast and efficient system that could generate terrain, albeit it had a lot of room to grow and improve.
